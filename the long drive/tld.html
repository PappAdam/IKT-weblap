        <p>This is a car tour game in an almost endless randomly generated desert. The point is freedom, leadership, discovery and immersion. Includes minimal car maintenance and surviving elements.</p>

        <h1>About the game</h1>
        <p>
            There are no invisible walls or impenetrable low fences or flashing red "wrong direction" signs on the display. The car will not consume 10 to 20 gallons of gasoline for a few hundred meters, with a full tank, you could go about 500 kilometers. If you see a big mountain in the distance, you can go there and if you can, you can go up on it. If you donâ€™t like where the mirrors are looking, you can adjust them however you want or throw them away while going full speed. If you want, you can get out of the car or closer to the radio or whatever.
